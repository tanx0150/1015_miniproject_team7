# About our project
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) and our team's objective build a model that can predict the unit sales for items sold at the grocery store.

#### context (can put in presentation)
Forecasts are especially relevant to brick-and-mortar grocery stores, which must dance delicately with how much inventory to buy. Predict a little over, and grocers are stuck with overstocked, perishable goods. Guess a little under, and popular items quickly sell out, leading to lost revenue and upset customers. More accurate forecasting can decrease food waste related to overstocking and improve customer satisfaction.

## Algorithms used
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- SARIMA Model
- Holt-Winters Forecasting Model

## Contributors
- Xin Min: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Max: Machine learning techniques, data-driven insights
- Ezekiel: Presentation slides and recommendations

## Conclusion
- Use Machine Learning (ML) to predict sales using time series data
- Forecast how sales will look based on past data
- Holt-Winters model performed the best as it had the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) etc out of all models
- Using data predictions, a grocery store can estimate how much of an item to buy and when to buy that amount in accordance to trends, and can prevent both understocking and overstocking products.

## What we learnt 
- How to do data handling and analysis
- Identified patterns, trends, correlations in the data using EDA
- Time Series Forecasting
- New modeling techniques and machine learning algorithms
- How to use evaluation metrics to assess the performance of models

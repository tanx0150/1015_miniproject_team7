# About our project
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) and our team's objective build a model that can predict the unit sales for items sold at the grocery store.

#### context (can put in presentation)
Forecasts are especially relevant to brick-and-mortar grocery stores, which must dance delicately with how much inventory to buy. Predict a little over, and grocers are stuck with overstocked, perishable goods. Guess a little under, and popular items quickly sell out, leading to lost revenue and upset customers. More accurate forecasting can decrease food waste related to overstocking and improve customer satisfaction.
